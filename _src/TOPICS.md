# SEO content plan — Văn Phú Đà Lạt (https://vanphudalat.com/)

Owner: Phú. Report language: Vietnamese.

## How a new article is added
1. Pick the first unchecked topic in "Backlog". The backlog is a dated daily calendar (one article per day); follow its order. If a day was missed, just take the next unchecked one. Topics marked (publish ~date) wait until that date.
2. Add the article to **every** file in `content/` (en, ru, zh, ko, ja, th, id, ms, vi, de, fr, es, he) under the **same key**, appended at the END of `C["articles"]` (order = publish order).
   Tuple: `(slug, title_tag, h1, meta_description, lead, image_name, html_body)`
   - slug: en/zh/ko/ja/th/id/ms/de/fr/es/he → same English kebab slug; ru → transliterated Russian slug; vi → Vietnamese kebab slug without diacritics.
   - image_name: one of the files in `/img` without `.jpg`: electric-row, electric-helmets, airblade, fleet-gas, vision-white (do NOT use guest-1/guest-2 as article images).
   - html_body: `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<ul><li>` only. Link to the routes page with `<a href="{ROUTES}">…</a>` when relevant.
3. In `content/en.py` add the publish date: `C["dates"]["<key>"] = "YYYY-MM-DD"` (create `C["dates"] = {}` if missing).
4. `python3 _src/build_site.py && python3 _src/check.py` — must print ALL CHECKS PASSED.
5. Move the topic to "Published" with date and key. Commit + push to `main`.

## Hard rules (business owner's decisions — never break)
- NEVER mention driving licences/permits in any language (no "license", "права", "驾照", "bằng lái", etc.) — EXCEPT on the licence pillar page (`content/licence.py`, all 18 languages) and the vi/en guides (`content/guides.py`). Owner decision 2026-10-28: gas scooters need a motorbike licence valid under Vietnamese law (A1 covers up to 125cc); electric scooters are mopeds (≤50 km/h, motor ≤4 kW) → no licence (Law 36/2024/QH15), minimum age 16. Do NOT go into international-permit details (no 1949/1968, no IDP) — say only "a licence valid under Vietnamese law". Other articles keep linking to the licence page instead of discussing licences themselves.
- Electric-scooter range: only as the owner-approved figures "one battery lasts about 25–30 km; each scooter comes with 2 batteries, about 50–60 km in total" (battery swap at the shop 20,000 VND). Never any other number, never "per charge" wording.
- Electric scooters: max 2 riders with combined weight under 140 kg (owner changed from 100 kg on 2026-10-18); avoid long steep passes (Prenn, Mimosa, Lang Biang) — suggest the Air Blade 125cc for long trips.
- Prices: 150,000 VND/day for every bike, fixed, no discounts (never advertise a lower or "from" price — the owner always charges 150,000 VND). Always write the currency as "VND" in every language — never đ, ₫, донг, ดอง, 동, ドン, 越南盾, דונג. Bikes: Honda Vision 110cc, Honda Air Blade 125cc, electric scooter. No cash deposit — guest leaves passport or ID card. Free helmet. Phone holder on every bike; gas scooters come with 1 liter of fuel. Free hotel delivery in central Da Lat for 2+ days. Rental day = pickup until 21:00. Test ride + video of bike condition before rental.
- Contacts: WhatsApp +84 944 081 101 / +84 834 622 149, Zalo 0944 081 101, Telegram @vanphudalat, WeChat vanphudalat, Russian Telegram channel t.me/dalat_life_vietnam. Shop: 1/15/5 Thông Thiên Học, Đà Lạt.
- Rules to mention where natural: no alcohol/beer when riding; strictly follow Vietnamese traffic law.
- Facts about places: only well-established ones; distances/times as approximate ("about", "около", "约"). No invented prices of tickets/hotels, no invented opening hours, no fake reviews or quotes, no claims about competitors.
- Write each language natively (not word-for-word); keep the article genuinely useful to a traveller (≈450–700 words in en). Avoid keyword stuffing.
- Hebrew (he) is right-to-left; write natural Israeli Hebrew, plural address (אתם), avoid recommending pork dishes. German/French/Spanish: natural, informal-friendly tone (du / vous / tú).
- Malay: avoid pork dishes as recommendations; mention halal where food is discussed. Thai/Malay/Indonesian readers drive on the left at home — remind "Vietnam drives on the right" if riding is discussed.

- Photo-spot map page (/photo-map/, all 13 languages) is built from `content/photomap.py`; the pagoda map (/pagoda-map/, 7 pagodas) from `content/pagodamap.py`, the church map (/church-map/, 6 churches) from `content/churchmap.py`, the wild-sunflower map (/wild-sunflower-map/, 9 dã quỳ spots, season late Oct–Dec) from `content/sunflowermap.py`, the cloud-hunting map (/cloud-hunting-map/, 8 sunrise spots) from `content/cloudmap.py`, the café map (/cafe-view-map/, 12 view cafés) from `content/cafemap.py`, all 13 languages. Their PDFs live in `/files/` (VanPhu-Dalat-Photo-Map-XX.pdf, VanPhu-Dalat-Pagoda-Map-XX.pdf, VanPhu-Dalat-Church-Map-XX.pdf, VanPhu-Dalat-Wild-Sunflower-Map-XX.pdf, VanPhu-Dalat-Cloud-Hunting-Map-XX.pdf, VanPhu-Dalat-Cafe-View-Map-XX.pdf); the BBQ map (/bbq-map/, 9 grill restaurants) from `content/bbqmap.py`, all 13 languages (files/VanPhu-Dalat-BBQ-Map-XX.pdf); the 5-star hotels map (/5-star-hotels-map/, 8 hotels/resorts listed as 5-star by 2+ sources; Terracotta, Dalat Wonder left out as not consistently 5-star) from `content/hotelmap.py` (files/VanPhu-Dalat-5-Star-Hotels-Map-XX.pdf); the 4-star hotels map (/4-star-hotels-map/, 10 hotels listed as 4-star by 2+ sources with 800+ reviews) from `content/fourstarmap.py` (files/VanPhu-Dalat-4-Star-Hotels-Map-XX.pdf); the 3-star hotels map (/3-star-hotels-map/, 8 hotels listed as 3-star by 2+ sources with 250+ reviews) from `content/threestarmap.py` (files/VanPhu-Dalat-3-Star-Hotels-Map-XX.pdf); the Saigon bus map (/saigon-bus-map/, Da Lat bus station + 12 bus company offices, no fares/timetables) from `content/busmap.py` (files/VanPhu-Dalat-Saigon-Bus-Map-XX.pdf); the Da Nang bus map (/da-nang-bus-map/, Da Lat bus station + 6 company offices on the Da Nang / Hoi An route, kept only when 2+ sources agree and the office matches Google Maps; no fares/timetables) from `content/danangbusmap.py` (files/VanPhu-Dalat-Da-Nang-Bus-Map-XX.pdf); the Flower Festival 2026 page (/flower-festival-2026/, 11th edition, planned 19–31 Dec 2026 per the 8 Oct 2026 press briefing — all dates marked as planned; update when the official schedule is out) from `content/festivalmap.py` (files/VanPhu-Dalat-Flower-Festival-2026-XX.pdf), its banner on the home page sits below the map section (owner asked: not at the top). Do not delete them. Articles about sights or pagodas may link to them with a relative link to `photo-map/` or `pagoda-map/` in their language.

- Licence pillar page (owner asked 2026-10-28, all 18 languages): /do-i-need-a-license-to-rent-a-motorbike-in-vietnam/ (en), /vi/thue-xe-may-co-can-bang-lai/, /ru/nuzhny-li-prava-chtoby-arendovat-bayk-vo-vetname/, other languages /<l>/do-i-need-a-license-to-rent-a-motorbike-in-vietnam/. Built by page_licence() from `content/licence.py`; linked from the electric-scooter page, the vi/en guides and the articles in LIC_FROM (build_site.py). Do not delete it.

- "Before the trip" cluster hub (owner asked 2026-10-28, all 18 languages): night-bus arrival pillar /arriving-in-da-lat-early-by-night-bus/ (vi /vi/xe-dem-den-da-lat-sang-som/, ru /ru/nochnoy-avtobus-v-dalat-rano-utrom/), built by page_pillar() from `content/arrive.py`. Facts: HCMC overnight buses arrive about 4–7 am, Nha Trang buses run in the daytime (3.5–4 h), bus station 1 Tô Hiến Thành open 24 h, station→shop about 3 km. No fares/timetables/company recommendations; never promise bus-station delivery. Cluster pages linking back: articles in ARR.FROM (getting, lt-early, lt-caudat-early, cloudhunt, lt-procedure) and the 3 bus maps (ARR.MAPS_FROM). New 'before the trip' articles should link to this hub. Do not delete it.

- "Da Lat by motorbike" pillar = the existing routes page (/routes/, vi /vi/lo-trinh/, all 18 languages), upgraded in place 2026-10-28 instead of a new competing URL. Extra sections come from `content/routeshub.py` (which bike per route with round-trip km and electric yes/no, approved EV range box, plan/before chips, rental box, FAQ). Keep ROWS in the same order as C[l]["routes"]["items"]. New itinerary/map pages should be added to PLAN so the pillar links them.

- Videos (owner's YouTube Shorts): EV_VIDEO (vJebSgBDFOo, fleet at the shop, 2026-10-28) is on the electric-scooter page and the lt-ev-foreigners / lt-ev-city articles in all languages; VIDEO_ART maps article → video, VIDEO_DATE holds upload dates. add_ld() writes a VideoObject for every embedded video. New videos: add the id to VIDEO_DATE and the page to VIDEO_ART.

- Structured data (owner asked 2026-10-28): write() adds the LocalBusiness/AutoRental entity (04:30–21:00, priceRange, geo) to every indexable page that lacks it, and a FAQPage built only from visible Q&A (<details> and genuine question <h2>s; contact/CTA headings excluded). hreflang: every multilingual page lists all 18 languages + x-default; single-language pages (vi streets, xe số, Vision, id halal/tour, guides) have none on purpose.

- Tourist map by motorbike route (owner asked 2026-10-28, vi + en only): /vi/ban-do-du-lich-da-lat/ and /da-lat-tourist-map/, built by page_tourmap() from `content/tourmap.py` — 6 loops from the shop reusing spots from placeshub + attractmap; distances straight-line with a labelled by-road estimate (x1.3–1.5); a loop is marked electric-scooter OK only if every stop is EV-OK and the estimated road km ≤ 45. Targets the keyword "bản đồ du lịch Đà Lạt". Do not delete it.

- `/go/` is the QR landing page printed on bike stickers (hand-written HTML, not built by build_site.py). Never delete it; community links are in the COMMUNITY block at the top of its script.

- Vietnamese-only street pages (owner asked: Vietnamese only, no other languages): /vi/thue-xe-may-da-lat/<duong-...>/ — one page per street of phường Xuân Hương – Đà Lạt ("Thuê xe máy Đà Lạt đường X", delivery focus) + hub /vi/thue-xe-may-da-lat/phuong-xuan-huong/. Data in `content/streets_vi.py` (unique intro + tip per street; outer=True → "gọi trước để hỏi giao xe"). Do not translate them.

- Indonesian funnel block (owner asked 2026-10-28): every /id/ page shows a consultation block above the footer (ready-made WhatsApp messages: itinerary, halal food, rental, join the "Dalat Bareng Phu" community), 2 real Google reviews and a short FAQ. Text lives in `content/funnelid.py`, rendered by `id_funnel()` in build_site.py. Do not remove it; edit only funnelid.py. When the owner's Indonesian Facebook group / WhatsApp Community exist, the "Gabung komunitas" button can point there.

## Long-tail backlog — rental keywords (ONE per day, in addition to the daily travel article)
Purpose: rank for longer, less competitive rental searches in every language. Rules for these articles:
- Each article answers ONE specific search intent with practical, honest info (≈450–650 words in en). Never a near-copy of the main rental page or of existing articles `price` (rental prices) and `evgas` (electric vs gas) — link to them instead.
- Title/H1/meta built around the natural local phrase for that intent in EACH language (research how people really search it in that language, e.g. vi "thuê xe máy Đà Lạt không cần cọc", ru "аренда байка в Далате без залога", zh "大叻租摩托车 不用押金", th "เช่ามอเตอร์ไซค์ดาลัด ไม่ต้องมัดจำ"). Use the phrase naturally 2–4 times; no stuffing.
- Link to the main rental page with <a href="{HOME}">…</a> and, for electric topics, to <a href="{EV}">…</a>.
- All Hard rules apply (no licence wording in any language, no invented facts, no competitor claims). Hotel delivery only exactly as the owner's rule: free delivery to hotels in central Da Lat for rentals of 2+ days (never promise it for 1-day rentals — say "message us").
- OWNER'S KEYWORD PLAN (16/10/2026): focus on 4 niche groups — (1) no cash deposit & quick paperwork, (2) early opening / cloud hunting / sunrise, (3) electric scooters (EV backlog), (4) delivery & location. Each topic below lists its exact Vietnamese target keyword → the vi title_tag, H1 and meta must contain it verbatim (natural capitalisation); other languages use their own natural equivalent.
- OWNER'S KEYWORD PLAN 2 (17/10/2026, English-search priorities): each topic below marked [KW2] lists an exact English target phrase → the en title_tag, H1 and meta must contain it (natural capitalisation); vi and other languages use their natural equivalent. Already covered, do NOT write new articles for: "Dalat motorbike rental price" / "How much does it cost to rent a scooter in Dalat" (existing `price`), "Dalat motorbike rental requirements" (lt-documents), "Best places to visit around Dalat by scooter" (routes page + photospots), "What to know before riding a scooter in Dalat" (riding + lt-first-time). Never write "international driving permit" topics; licence questions are answered only on the licence pillar page (/do-i-need-a-license-to-rent-a-motorbike-in-vietnam/, vi /vi/thue-xe-may-co-can-bang-lai/).
- Internal links: add every new key to its cluster in `content/cluster.py` ("Read also" then shows cluster siblings first), and link 1–2 sibling articles in the body with <a href="{ART:<key>}">…</a>.
- "Documents" topics: the ONLY documents are passport (foreigners) or CCCD/ID card (Vietnamese guests). Never mention any other document, licence or permit.

- Languages: 13 original + it, nl, km, lo, my via `content/_langs.py` (NEW/META); each new language needs `<l>.py`, `<l>_art.py`, `<l>_maps.py` (one MAPS entry per map module). Khmer, Lao and Myanmar texts await a native-speaker check.
- PDFs: built with Chromium, then shrunk with ghostscript + qpdf (font subsets merged); CJK PDFs use fontsource Noto Sans SC/JP/KR (TrueType) instead of the system .ttc fonts, which Chromium embedded as large Type 3 fonts.

- Day-trip set (route maps routenew/routecheckin, day hub, hub reference prices) in 16 more languages: one file per language _src/content/dt_<l>.py, loaded by content/daytr.py. Route PDFs: MAPMOD=routenew|routecheckin pdf.py for all 18.
- Waterfalls map (waterfallmap.py + waterfallmap_tr/_tr2, 18 langs): 6 open waterfalls; Hang Cop, Gougah closed (2026), Tam Tham/Ankroet/Bobla left out.
- Night-view café map (nightcafemap.py + _tr/_tr2, 18 langs): 6 cafés on east hills chosen by owner; PDF uses PROJ_CENTER (cluster) and no rings.

- Address (owner, 2026-10-23): new address 1/15/5 Thông Thiên Học, Xuân Hương – Đà Lạt is primary everywhere; the Google Business Profile still shows the OLD address "Khu Quy Hoạch / L8 Đường Bùi Thị Xuân, Xuân Hương – Đà Lạt, Lâm Đồng 670000" (same shop). Every page shows both (contacts block, schema disambiguatingDescription, llms.txt). Keep both until the owner says the GBP address was changed.

- Phones (owner, 2026-10-23): two numbers on every page (contacts + footer + schema contactPoint) to match Google Maps: 0944 081 101 (main, call buttons) and 0834 622 149.
